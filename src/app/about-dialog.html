        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=75902pb19">75902pb19</a> 
        even though it is used as a vehicle decal in a Technic set.</li>
    <li><b>Any element that is held by a minifig as a shield.</b> Accounts for the inclusion of 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=98834pb02">98834pb02</a> even

        (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=14769pb523">14769pb523</a>), as in
